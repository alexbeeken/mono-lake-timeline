The Public Trust case was originally argued as: National Audubon Society v. Los Angeles. Superior Court of Alpine County No. 6429. It carried this title when it reached the California Supreme Court: National Audubon Society v. Superior Court. 33 Cal. 3d 419 (1983).",

  "Sept. 28, 1994 - State Water Resources Control Board Decision, D-1631: On this date, the SWRCB issued its landmark decision amending DWP's water diversion licenses in the Mono Basin. The purpose of the Water Board's decision is twofold: to comply with Fish and Game Codes 5937 & 5946, and to protect public trust values at Mono Lake as ordered by the California Supreme Court in 1983. D-1631 calls for a lake level of 6392 feet, which will take about 20 years to achieve. During this period, some diversions will be allowed to Los Angeles. Once the lake reaches 6392 feet, DWP will be able to divert, on average, 31,000 acre-feet of water, or about 1/3 of the City's historical diversion from the Mono Basin. The difference will be more than made up for by replacement water supplies. D-1631 orders DWP to develop plans to restore waterfowl and stream habitat damaged as a result of diversions, and to pay implementation costs associated with the restoration. More background on D1631.",
